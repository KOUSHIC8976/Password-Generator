# Python-Password-Entropy
Python Password Entropy is a standalone, command-line utility designed to enforce modern cryptographic policy standards across development and operations environments. Built on core Python security libraries (secrets, hashlib), it moves beyond obsolete, rules-based password validation to provide mathematically verifiable security metrics. It is a tool for SecOps teams, developers, and auditors who require strength and integrity of their application keys, cryptographic keys, and user credentials.

The utility addresses the two vulnerabilities in credential management: predictable entropy and known compromises, offering a singular solution to achieve compliance with modern security benchmarks like NIST SP 800-63B.

Usage:
python app.py audit "Password",

python app.py audit "Password" --breach,

python app.py -h
