# Random-Password-Generator
This Python script generates random passwords of a specified length, incorporating a customizable set of characters including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The function utilizes the random and string modules to ensure robust randomness. By default, the script creates a 12-character password with all four character sets enabled, but users can adjust the length and character set selection to tailor the password generation to specific security requirements. The code prioritizes clear function design and modularity for easy integration and potential expansion, offering a foundational tool for password generation tasks.
